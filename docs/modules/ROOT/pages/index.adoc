= Quarkus Logging Manager

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

The Quarkus Logging Manager Extension provides you endpoints to visualize and manage the log level of your loggers.

== Installation

If you want to use this extension, you need to add the `io.quarkiverse.loggingmanager:quarkus-logging-manager` extension first to your build file.

For instance, with Maven, add the following dependency to your POM file:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.loggingmanager</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-logging-manager</artifactId>
    <version>${logger-manager.version}</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>

----

== OpenAPI

You can include the Logger Manager API in the OpenAPI document (and thus also Swagger UI). This needs to be enabled via config:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.logging-manager.openapi.included=true
----

Simply run your application with `mvn quarkus:dev` and execute your code. This will then add the following to your OpenAPI:

== Security

Security of endpoints is important and we do not want to allow unknown people to know (or worse, change!) the log levels of our applications. 
Fortunately we can secure our endpoints using Quarkus' default security mechanism, as described in Security Overview. 
All you have to do is define your application.properties similar to this:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.basic=true # If you want basic auth. Multiple auth mechanism are supported

quarkus.http.auth.policy.admin-access.roles-allowed=admin
quarkus.http.auth.permission.roles1.paths=/q/logging-manager
quarkus.http.auth.permission.roles1.policy=admin-access
----

And, in case you chose Basic Auth, provide a IdentityProvider (either by implementing one or adding an extension that provides one). 
Quarkus will take care of matching the paths (in this case /q/logging-manager to the policy you defined and granting or denying access). 
Then you can also secure all the endpoints in your application using this configuration.
